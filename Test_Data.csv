14,0.1141934,   Kosher   I undid Kuratowskis ghosts edit sorry  Its not so interesting whether or not the hyrax is kosher  unless you want to hunt or breed them and theyre a protected species in Israel so you cant do either anyway  Whats interesting is the issue of whether they chew the cud or not  This is both for zoological and theological reasons  Firstly because their digestive system is rather complex and they do not strictly chew cud ruminate nor do they coprphage like rabbits  An explanation for the chewing motions is given under Characteristics but Im not sure I subscribe to it  from personal observations when theyre threatened theyd sooner try to bite your finger off lol  From a religious perspective it raises questions about the breadth of zoological available to the authors of the Bible see the reference The Camel the Hare and the Hyrax for more information on this or if you subscribe to divine authorship what was Gods intention by presenting this tantalising information  Therefore I think the reference to cud chewing should remain

16,0.2381206,  Hello  My name is Maxine and something interesting caught my attention The word Bitch is noted and considered an insult by your standards Bitch InsultenwikipediaorgwikiBitchinsult which I agree with 100 However I noticed that the word Nigger enwikipediaorgwikiNigger‎ is not Even though in your definition it states it as an ethnic slur So is an ethnic slur not an insult and or considered as such As well as I am very curious on the process and who determines if a word here is an insult or not   To me the word Nigger is an insult In days of slavery the term Nigger Bitch was a common  used practice to describe Black Women Is this not derogatory and insulting I would think the word should look like this on your site Nigger Insult As it is even against the law to refer to someone as such today   I am very interested in your input regarding this matter Thank you  Sincerely  Maxine A Moncrieffe      10212013
