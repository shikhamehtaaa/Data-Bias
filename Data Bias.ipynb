      "If you had tried to read my changes, you would have seen that I have changed some things and that I am constantly changing some wording. In the last reply you deleted the link to the results of the municipal elections from 1990. Do you even read those changes? In the whole discussion you did not give me a single argument that my changes do not stand. Why did I reject the court in The Hague? Why did even one of my changes negate anything pronounced at the Hague court? I have not said anywhere about Blaškić's verdict, read my words again that there were no crimes in Ahmići, nor did I mention in any way at all the role of the Republic of Croatia in the entire conflict. I said that you stick to the statements from The Hague without proving them. There were appeals in which previous convictions were rejected. For example, Kupreškići. But all of that is totally irrelevant to my changes. There are 5 things that I persistently erase 555 times 1 HDZ won in most of the municipalities that he wanted to include in HB, you have the results of the elections on link 2 for secession and organizing a new government, he blamed the ineffectiveness of the government in Sarajevo What is the problem What new government, especially if it is a putschist, does not blame the old one for all the problems 3 HB was declared a republic for the time of the Geneva negotiations, in which the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina into 3 ethnic republics was discussed, the OwenStoltenberg Plan. Should every single term have a link, and the links I provided to you are obviously not very useful, because when you asked me for the election results later, you deleted the sentence just like that and said that the results don't matter at all, why did you ask me for sources 4 stories about the beginning of the war The war broke out after the Travnička Canton was assigned to the Croats and the HVO tried to clear A BiH from it, i.e. conflicts over joint military forces wanceowenow plan 5 about the use of symbols and money On all those symbols Croats had the right as a constructive people, and as far as money is concerned, the main currency during the war was the German mark. Forcing students of other nations to adhere to the Croatian curriculum is unconstitutional, but I didn't have time to formulate it properly. None of these things came to the detriment of either the Bosnian authorities or in justifying HBa All things describe the situation as it was in the area of ​​HBa from the settlement of refugees onwards. The only thing that could possibly be disputed is the part about Croatian fear, but that also does not yet have the correct wording. Every change is in accordance with the NPOV wikipedia policy and not I can see why there should be a specific link for each of these things. At least 10 times I have asked you to help me with the wording of each of the listed things instead of just deleting them. it says that you can quote someone else's opinion without agreeing with it. The part with the generalization of the Croatian opinion may be my fault, but I can't find the correct wording for a situation in which 8090 electorates elect members of one party whose official opinion is such and such. some pages lead to absolutely nothing and especially don't use wikipedia. I think what's your point in returning everything to the old way despite all the evidence. At the very beginning of the discussion you asked me for sources for the results of the 1990 election, and I'll send them to you, and you still delete the sentence for which you asked for support. Come on. please try to read it a bit and think about everything that was said. None of my intentions were bad, nor do they serve to impose someone else's opinion, nor to justify HB for the millionth time, but to expand the context. at least as a source of one of those statements What is the difference between the sentence the HerzegBosnian leadership is presently awaiting trial at the ICTY on charges including Crimes Against Humanity and stating a specific accusation of a crime Every crime regardless of nationality should be punished Are the red blood cells of someone because what makes one nationality immune to war crimes I read your request not to insert the same things all the time and here read everything I wrote work on the wording and feel free to insert my changes in the text in due course UserCehaCeha\n"

      "Listen S is the new rest system of the rockets after the acceleration is finished Why is this so hard to understand So if you perform a Lorentz transformation of points A and B from system S where the ships are moving with v after acceleration to S where they are at rest after acceleration you are calculating the endpoints of resting objects in S thus you have the rest length of the objects and the distance between the endpoints And what do the LorentzTrafos tell us Well they unambiguously show that the distance between A and B again those are the coordinates of the endpoints of in S resting objects has increased as compared to the coordinate length between A and B in S Of course this is in perfect agreement with relativity of simultaneity which shows that the spaceships started at different times in S thus they had different accelerations  Summarizing 1 You have two endpoints A and B with different accelerations in S therefore they are moving away from each other in S and after the acceleration the distance of the now resting objects has increased and the string has been stretched 2 Of course one can also choose frame S in which the accelerations appeared to be the same due to relativity of simultaneity and therefore the increased distance in S apparently stays the same in S Actually one should abandon the word appear in relativity it serves no purpose and only distracts one from correctly applying the Lorentztransformation   Now Dewan Beran and Bell unfortunately started with 2 and only afterwards at 1 so they had to focus their attention mostly on S and on length contraction which caused much confusion by some readers But the paradox is much easier to understand if one like Petkov and Franklin starts with 1 and then look at 2  BTW As explained above modern authors understand the paradox very well and some of them even try to confirm it experimentally Bells spaceship paradox in electron interferometry      \n",

      "   Sockpuppetry investigation closed   Hi  Ive closed the sockpuppetry investigation that was opened against you on November 3  The evidence presented to suggest that the account  was your sockpuppet was not sufficiently convincing in my opinion to justify taking action  However in the course of the investigation five other accounts were uncovered which were judged either conclusively or on balance of probabilities to have been sockpuppets of yours      and   All of these accounts have been indefinitely blocked  I would strongly advise you not to create any more sockpuppet accounts unless you can provide a very very good explanation of what you are doing and why you need more than one account  The only reason you were not given a block right now is that the above sockpuppets hadnt been used for several weeks and any sanction against you at this time for these actions would be purely punitive something which Wikipedia sanctions are not supposed to be  Please carefully read the sockpuppetry policy WPSOCK and make sure your actions from here on are firmly on the good side of the line because any future action by you that seems likely to fall under the sockpuppetry umbrella will probably lead to you being blocked from editing  —  no relation to Jimbo \n",
